### **Assignment instructions:**

For most writers, a big problem is writing block. Where you can't think of what to write
and you can't write anything.

One of the most interesting solutions to this is a web app called The Most Dangerous
Writing App, an online text editor where if you stop writing, all your progress will be
lost.

A timer will count down and when the website detects the user has not written anything in
the last 5/10 seconds, it will delete all the text they've written so far.

Try it out here:

You are going to build a desktop app that has similar functionality. The design is up to
you, but it should allow a user to type and if they stop for more than 5 seconds, it
should delete everything they've written soc far.
